Hi, I am etdoh...

I am a recent Computer Science graduate and the stuff that will be stored on this account will be a mix of projects and my learnings. 
I love coding, in particular low level programming. I have alwyas had an interest in computer hardware so being able to talk as close as possible wihtout going to assembly is something I aim to master.... may do some assembly, someday.
My most proficcient language is C++, however I am currently leanrning Rust due to the memory and thread safety whilst maintaining its high speeds. 

I also enjoy Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Mathematics. One of my favourite projects was implementing a Multi layer perpceptron using back propagation manually. Which involved a lot of calculus, but I loved it. 

Being a recent graduate one of my favourite areas of study was Advanced Computer Architecture, in particular the processor. I loved the mathematics behind it and plan to emulate such hardware throughout the coming months. 
Once comfortable in Rust I am to create my first emulator - CHIP-8.

Currently I am working on a blog written in a Rust back end with Rocket and Diesel. All code will be posted and updated.

Thanks for reading, Etdoh.
